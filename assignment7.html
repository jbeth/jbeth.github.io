    <h1>Assignment 7</h1>

    <p>Lesson seven covered the fundamentals of networking including the OSI model, networking devices and structures,
        internet protocols, and setting up small office/home office networks. The first activity I would like to touch
        on is the activity to verify network connectivity. Being able to do this effectively helps in the
        troubleshooting process immensely by narrowing down if communication errors are on the network or only specific
        to the application or machine that is experiencing those issues. This is something I use almost daily in my
        current position. My team manages the day-to-day remediation and management tasks for all of the servers in our
        environment, both on-prem and in Azure. This includes ensuring that these servers can communicate across subnets
        and VLANs to our management consoles like SCOM, which is especially difficult with Azure machines considering
        Azure networks default to deny all access outside the subnet and are very segmented. This means that when there
        are problems with communication on our Azure machines we often use tools such as nslookup, tracert, and
        test-netconnection in PowerShell to determine where the connection issue is coming from.</p>

    <p>The next activity I would like to discuss is on sharing and connecting to shared folders. Understanding how to
        set up, access, and share network folders and locations aids in more effective collaboration and potentially
        reduced resource costs through centralized storage. This is also something I manage regularly at work. There are
        certain restricted folders that my team manages access for using Active Directory security groups that only we
        have permission to modify. We will create new shared folders and network drives based on business request and
        configure the DFS sharing settings to ensure it is accessible by the right groups of people. I also have
        experience migrating shared locations or mount points when servers are rebuilt or migrated to new hosts,
        including unmounting and remounting shared network drives for database and SQL servers. Although we do not have
        any Macs in our environment right now, there is an initiative in progress to expand our supported machines to
        include Macs in the future, and knowing how to access network resources on a Mac interface will no doubt prove
        useful.</p>

    <p>The final activity I would like to touch on is what is required to set up a personal at-home network. Up until
        the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I commuted to the office and my home network was fairly basic for its
        purpose to support my videogame hobby. I had researched and purchased a modem and separate router that supported
        2.5ghz and 5ghz frequencies, as well as gigabit bandwidth support on each of the ports and built-in QoS
        protocols to ensure there were no issues with my online games. Once I started working from home it was easy to
        set up a more secure home network using the features available with the router, in addition to not having to
        worry about the additional bandwidth requirements causing any network bottlenecks. The transition to a home
        office network setup was relatively painless thanks to my advanced research to ensure my components would be
        able to support my heavier network usage from my gaming hobby.</p>
