    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>

    <p>Lesson two covered the use and customization of a few popular web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge,
        Opera, Brave, and Safari. The third activity in this lesson had us review and configure various features in
        these browsers after installation. My biggest takeaway from this was just how similar all of these browsers are
        when it comes to setting configurations. Even if the menus are located in separate places or designed in
        slightly different layouts, the core locations of most settings are relatively similar. Knowing this, it should
        be far easier for me to work in unfamiliar environments such as macOS concerning troubleshooting and support as
        my company expands our environment to include Apple platforms.</p>

    <p>The next activity in this lesson that I will be reflecting on is activity five, which had us view, install, and
        disable addons in our browsers. In this lesson, I discovered that addons I had been using for years that may
        have once been supported only in Chrome or Firefox were now available cross-platform in other browsers. This has
        made me re-evaluate why I use Chrome as my preferred browser and encouraged me to investigate other browsers to
        see if they have comparable features and use cases to supplement my work in ways that Chrome may not be designed
        or equipped to do.</p>

    <p>The last activity I would like to reflect on is the last activity of the lesson, where we were instructed to
        check our preferred web browser for compatibility with HTML5. Chrome is my preferred browser, and while I knew
        it was compatible with HTML5, I was surprised to find it was not 100% compatible with all the available
        features. It is less compatible with HTML5 features than Edge, which is fully compatible. I found this
        surprising since Edge tends to be the least used browser by members of the IT support teams Iâ€™ve been a member
        of in the past. This is additionally interesting as HTML5 is a functional replacement for Flash, and I wrapped
        up a project to remove Flash from the entire server environment at work in the summer of 2021.</p>
