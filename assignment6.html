Lesson six covered the very broad topic of IT as a career including resources for determining which career path might be best for me, how to search for jobs and network, and how to research salaries by position and location using statistics from the US Department of Labor, as well as how to write a resume and build a LinkedIn profile. The first point I would like to discuss is the section that covered career planning. I started my career in IT almost by accident, I applied for an opening for a third-party service desk. Computers had always been my passion and a hobby, so I was hired. This kicked off my now 10-year-long IT career and looking back, I am amazed at how far I have come without having a plan for most of it. Until I was hired at my current employer, many of my jobs did not invest in my professional development and so I struggled to define what a career in IT would look like to me. Now, after working with my career advisor and a mentor, I have a plan to allow me to move into the security field.

This leads to the second topic I would like to touch on, certifications in IT. Having been in the field for so long with no college education or degree has shown me how exceptionally powerful certifications are for showing your skills and aptitudes in the IT field. Especially with the myriad of disciplines to focus on such as networking or infrastructure, being able to definitively demonstrate your abilities in that discipline helps shape and advance your career down your chosen path. I was lucky to have a work environment that prefers to develop internal talent, but that is not every employer. Because of this, as I finish my associate's, I am also planning to sit the exams in the CompTIA Cybersecurity certification pathway with the hopes that this will lead to career advancement into the Identity and Access Management discipline of IT security.

The final point that I would like to touch on is the usefulness of networking and using LinkedIn to do so. Networking is something that I struggled with early on in my career but has paid off many times over for the investment I put into learning this skill. I landed my first job in IT by applying for a service desk position at a company where one of my friends worked at the time, and from there my colleagues moved on to my current employer where I was able to be hired for a service desk opening I had heard of by keeping in touch with them. Even achieving my current role can be attributed to networking with this team before joining, I made sure to put myself on a list of interested desktop support technicians to participate in a 6-month resource borrow program after applying a few times and being passed over. After I was able to network with and prove my skills to my current team, I received the offer for the next open position on the team.
