The first topic I would like to discuss in this week’s assignment is the initial activity regarding internet basics, specifically on the topic of Zoom fatigue. I participate in a high number of video calls at work due to my role being fully remote, and because of this I often forget to mentally reset or give myself allowances to decompress during or after these meetings. I had not realized how much more active engagement there is during video calls than in normal conversations, which I realize now helps contribute to my mental fatigue on meeting intensive days. There are a few suggestions I plan to implement both at work and in my personal life going forward which include allowing myself a preparatory period before or between meetings so I can refocus on the upcoming tasks, turning my camera off, or hiding the video window on meetings where it is not required, and ensuring that I will not be interrupted either physically by my roommate or virtually by setting my instant messenger status to do-not-disturb to limit non-urgent work messages.

The second topic I would like to discuss is the file management activity as it relates to macOS and Linux file management. The environment I work in is largely Windows-based so I already have a decent amount of experience in that regard but even though we do have some Linux and macOS machines I have not had the opportunity to work with them and so have limited experience with those file management systems. While the functionality between Windows and macOS file systems was not as different as I had anticipated, it was worthwhile learning the mouse and keyboard commands unique to the MacOS environment for manipulating, editing, deleting, and searching for files and folders. The same applies to my experience with Linux environments, much of the methods of using the Linux file management systems are similar to how I manage the Windows environment at work with regards to working through command prompt or PowerShell to manually execute modifications. The largest differences were in the command syntax itself, which I had not been exposed to very often before this. We are expanding into more Linux and macOS machines in my work environment, and so I look forward to having a better baseline understanding of these file management systems as my team takes on more administrative responsibilities for virtual machines using these operating systems.

Finally, I would like to touch on the activity for setting up GitHub to use for this course. This is something that has been on my radar for a while as my workplace is moving towards infrastructure as a service and terraform deployment of cloud resources. We use GitHub as part of that, but I don’t have much experience with it yet. Just learning the basic processes for building repositories and syncing them locally has been illuminating, and I am looking forward to getting more use and familiarity with this platform. I hope in this way to already have a head start on the fundamentals when more widescale GitHub use is rolled out in the environment I support.
