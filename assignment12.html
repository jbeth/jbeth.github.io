        <h1>Assignment 12</h1>

        <p class="ex1">The biggest takeaway from this lesson for me was with regards to the assumptions I made about web
            accessibility while working through all my assignments. I didn’t realize that having sectioned content
            specifically tagged in the HTML code would be so impactful. I hadn’t considered the impact but after
            updating some of my later assignments to be more accessible, they were a bit easier for me to go back and
            interact with as well. I hope to carry this perspective forward with me at work and in my personal life,
            that making content accessible benefits everyone, not just those who need it.</p>
