    <h1>Assignment 5</h1>

    <p>Lesson five this week covered two connected topics; social media technologies used to create and share
        information and virtual expression, and communications technologies used over the internet such as file transfer
        or sharing and voice over internet applications. While I had peripherally known about many of the social media
        sites referenced in this lesson, I had not taken the time to get familiar with all of them until now. There are
        a few that I use regularly such as Facebook for my personal life and LinkedIn for sharing my professional
        information, with strict privacy settings on both to help limit access by wanted groups or individuals. What I
        didn’t realize was just how many messaging apps there are out there! I use Facebook Messenger, Signal, and
        Discord for most of my messaging but there are apps I had not even heard of such as Line and Hike that do almost
        the same thing as WhatsApp with only subtle differences in the user interface and use methods.</p>

    <p>Another topic that caught my interest in this lesson was the difference between the consumer-based VoIP programs
        I am familiar with like Google Hangouts and Skype versus the VoIP programs I use at work like Zoom, WebEx, and
        Cisco Jabber – which we use for our softphone application. While all of these applications serve the same
        general function, the differences in features and UI configurations span a large spectrum. WebEx, Zoom, and
        Google Hangouts can be used for individual video calls or video conference calls depending on the environment
        they are being used in, while applications like Jabber are designed to replace physical phones in the workplace
        while at the same time provide an instant messaging system but with no video integration. We are currently
        testing out Microsoft Teams at work, and I am interested to see the results of our pilot; the individual and
        team chat features are much easier to navigate than our current softphone/IM combo app, but I am unsure if the
        integrated video features will be well received in a business environment.</p>

    <p>The final point I would like to touch on is the resources that were discussed regarding the legal issues and
        potential penalties involved with illegal peer-to-peer file sharing, also known as "pirating". I remember this
        kind of file transfer for media sharing being popular when I was in junior high and high school in the early
        2000s with little regard to the legal ramifications, and it is still popular today despite the increase in
        regulation and crackdowns on those who pirate media illegally. With the wide variety of personal use VPNs and
        encryption software available today, it may even be easier than in the early days to use peer-to-peer file
        sharing to share and download copywritten materials. The wide availability of these applications may even make
        it difficult to differentiate legitimate file sharing traffic from illegal traffic when examining network use.
