    <h1>Assignment 3</h1>

    <p>Lesson three covered how search engines work including the fundamental processes that build and maintain search
        indexes, basic searching strategies, more advanced searching techniques such as phrase searching and Boolean
        operators, and how to cross-reference results to determine the accuracy and relevance of the returned
        information. The first topic I would like to touch on is one that I did not expect to necessarily be surprised
        by. I am quite used to using both public search engines like Google and private search indexes such as a
        SharePoint or service portal hosted knowledge bases but had not seriously considered much more to my technique
        other than the precision of phrasing for refining my results. I’ve seen just how effective more advanced
        operators are when it comes to refining search results and plan to start implementing this technique immediately
        at work.</p>

    <p>The second topic I would like to touch on is the concept of archiving old websites using Archive.org. I’ve
        learned that it is not just beneficial to archive old websites, it is relatively easy to do so as well. Sites
        can be archived manually through the website itself or more convenient browser extensions in Chrome, Firefox,
        and Safari. I’ve benefitted from archived websites in the past when referencing older versions of ITIL policies
        and plan to both use and save archived sites more in the future as I support legacy equipment in my employer’s
        environment.</p>

    <p>My final takeaway from this lesson is regarding being able to use Wikiversity’s Cite This Page feature to easily
        cite web sources in multiple formats. This is something I’ve struggled with as web citations were not common the
        last time I was in school, and so I never learned a structured way to do them. In my current systems
        administration role, and as I advance in my career moving forward, being able to effectively discern the
        relevance and accuracy of web content and then provide appropriate sourcing as part of our project and service
        management processes will only become more important.</p>
