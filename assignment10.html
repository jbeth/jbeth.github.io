    <h1>Assignment 10</h1>

    <p>Complete all Lesson 10 Activities. Then apply Lesson 10 concepts to your repository:</p>
    Use github.dev to edit your repository website.
    <br>Create an external styles.css page. Include styles for color, background-color, and font-family. Include any
    other styles you wish.
    <br>Add stylesheet links to all website pages to use the external stylesheet you created.
    <br>Add an assignment10.html page with valid HTML to your website. Include a Lorem ipsum paragraph you can format
    using internal and inline styles.
    <br>Add internal styles to the assignment10 page for a different color, background color, text alignment, font size,
    and/or font family.
    <br>Format the Lorem ipsum paragraph using internal styles.
    <br>Add inline styles to the Lorem ipsum paragraph to format a different color, background color, font size, and/or
    font family.
    <br>Update index.html to include navigation for the new web page.
    <br>Test website navigation by visiting your repository website at username.github.io.
    <br>Validate all web pages using the W3C HTML Validator and the W3C CSS Validator.

    <p>Create a 100-word summary of what you learned while completing the activities in this lesson and describe how you
        can apply that learning to your own current or future environment. Note that this is a learning summary, not an
        action summary. It is not necessary to describe specific steps completed, as those are already listed in the
        course materials. Instead, focus your summary efforts on what you learned from the activities and how you
        envision being able to apply these concepts. See the Assignment Rubric under Course Materials for more
        information.</p>
