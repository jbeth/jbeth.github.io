Complete all Lesson 8 Activities. Then create a 300-500 word summary of what you learned while completing three or more of the activities in this lesson and describe how you can apply that learning to your own current or future environment. Use a separate paragraph for each activity. Each paragraph must include:

The topic you are describing
What you learned about the topic
How you envision being able to apply the concept to your own current or future environment

Note that this is a learning summary, not an action summary. It is not necessary to describe specific steps completed, as those are already listed in the course materials. Instead, focus your summary efforts on what you learned from the activities and how you envision being able to apply these concepts. See the Assignment Rubric under Course Materials for more information.
