    <h1>Assignment 8</h1>

    <p>Lesson 8 covered security fundamentals including encryption and decryption, browser safety, malware, password
        standards, multi-factor authentication, firewalls, and ethical or legal security-related issues for IT
        professionals. The first activity I would like to discuss is practicing web browser safety which includes
        ensuring your browser settings are set correctly, that any addons are up to date and that the browser version
        itself is up to date. At work, we rely on Chrome and Edge for most of our browser use, which has both been set
        to automatically fetch the most recent version and install it when the browser is launched. This helps us to
        keep our browsers up to date without having to manually maintain any patching schedules. We also use a proxy
        server to filter internet content, and content block policies to proactively prevent connections to potentially
        unsafe or inappropriate sites. At home I have Chrome set up much the same, to automatically update as needed.

    <p>This leads to the second point I would like to touch on, which is using anti-malware to protect your system. My
        company uses CrowdStrike for passive protection and active scanning on our work computers, but at home, I use
        Avast antivirus and have for many years. Since I don’t have a proxy server with content filtering that I can
        manage myself, I rely on Avast for passive detection as well as the weekly active scans I run myself. I also
        have a personal VPN to supplement my home security efforts by keeping my IP address hidden while I am using the
        internet. My antivirus program has prevented a few potential threats over the years that I have used it, both by
        preventing malicious software from installing itself and by alerting me if the sites I am accessing are
        maliciously redirecting traffic or attempting unauthorized connections. Additionally, any malware I have needed
        to remove in the past has been easy to do using Avast, as the processes it uses are user-friendly and easy to
        understand and perform.</p>

    <p>The final point I would like to touch on for this lesson is using a password manager and multifactor
        authentication. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I took the leap and started using 1Password, and I regret
        not starting sooner. Not only do I have the ability to store my passwords and access them on both my work and
        personal computers by using a browser add-in or desktop application, but I can create local password vaults
        which allow me to store my work passwords on my work machine which uses full disk encryption and requires my
        master password for 1Password to even be able to access. Using this password manager allows me to use more
        complex passwords for both work and personal accounts because I only need the one master password to open my
        vault, and accessing it via the cloud or registering another machine requires additional access tokens that only
        I poses. For multifactor authentication, I can use my mobile Google authenticator to link to accounts that
        require it, which is accessed on my cell phone using my fingerprint for biometric authentication.</p>
