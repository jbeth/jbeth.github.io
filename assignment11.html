    <h1>Assignment 11</h1>

    <p>Iâ€™ve used graphics editing software like GIMP in the past but have never used vector graphics software before. I
        had already downloaded Inkscape prior to this course because it is often used in one of my hobbies, to draft
        patterns for bobbin lace. I had tried a few times to get started with this program but it was daunting. After
        working through the associated activities, I feel much more confident now that I have a basic familiarity with
        the controls and interface. I am excited to delve into vector image creation more deeply so I no longer have to
        draft my patterns by hand with a ruler, protractor, and graph paper.</p>
