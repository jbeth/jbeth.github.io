    <h1>Bobbin Lace - Old world skills for new world enjoyment!</h1>
    <p>I like to craft in my free time and have a few different crafting techniques I enjoy such as crochet, surface
        embroidery, and cross-stitch. Above all of these, I prefer making a style of lace known as bobbin lace. This is an old style
        of lace created by using wooden bobbins to weave threads together to form a pattern on a pillow, using pins to keep the
        pattern in place as you go. While most bobbin lace historically comes from Europe, below is an example of an American style 
        called Ipswitch lace. This reproduction is made using black silk thread and brass pins.</p>

    <p>This method of creating lace evolved from braid making in 16th century Italy and continued to be the premier method of lacemaking up until
        the industrial revolution when machines that could copy the weaving motions were created. This made lace more widely available and 
        affordable through mass production, though the women who made bobbin lace did not give up without a fight! These lacemakers 
        designed more complex lace that could not be replicated by machine, though that only extended their work for a little while. In 
        the end, they could not keep up with the amount of lace being produced and almost went out of business entirely. The modern-day is 
        showing a resurgence in bobbin lacemaking as a hobby as seen in the photo below of a contemporary attempt at a traditional 
        Buckinghamshire motif.</p>
