    <h1>Assignment 4</h1>

    <p>Lesson four covered email as a method for sending electronic communications between people as well as the
        security features and precautions related to safely using email. The biggest takeaway I had from this lesson was
        that Mozilla has an email platform that is used by the French military, a relationship that allows the French
        military to contribute to Thunderbirdâ€™s security features. I had always associated Mozilla with the Firefox
        browser, but now I will be exploring the options of using Thunderbird at home to help secure my emails. As it
        stands now, I primarily access my personal Gmail account on my mobile device or via the Chrome browser.</p>

    <p>Another topic I found interesting was learning how to find and evaluate email headers. I am used to being
        vigilant about spam and phishing emails, but I had not learned how to double-check email headers when it comes
        to detecting spoofing. After going through the tutorial on viewing headers for messages on multiple email
        platforms, I feel confident in being able to apply this tactic both in the Microsoft Exchange environment I use
        every day for work, and with my personal Gmail as well.</p>

    <p>The final takeaway I have from this lesson is less direct but still something that impacts my day-to-day work and
        is helpful to have context for. I had not realized before this lesson that bulk sending limitations have been
        set by various email service providers to limit the number of emails sent at once or the number of recipients on
        a single email. Different providers have different limits, but the use of an email list or distribution list
        appears to be the best method around these restrictions, and Exchange distribution lists are one of the many
        things I manage in my current role.</p>
