    <h1>Assignment 9</h1>

    <p>Lesson 9 was very interesting; I have some basic HTML experience from work as our previous knowledge repository
        used to use it for formatting. I haven’t used HTML since we transitioned over to our new repository, so
        formatting all of the assignments to date to work as functional web pages was a great way to start using those
        skills again. One major thing I learned through this assignment was actually not HTML related, it was to make
        sure my browser doesn’t cache webpages. I use Chrome for my personal browser and struggled for over 20 minutes
        trying to figure out why my index page wasn’t updating with the correct title only to realize it was because
        Chrome was caching a previous version of the page. It displayed correctly once I tested it in Edge.</p>
