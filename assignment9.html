    <h1>Assignment 9</h1>

    <p>Complete all Lesson 9 Activities. Then apply Lesson 9 concepts to your repository:</p>

    <p>Use github.dev to edit all assignment pages in your website repository to make them valid HTML web pages (head
        and body tags, etc.)</p>
        <br>Update the title for each page to match the page content (Assignment 1, Assignment 2, etc.).
        <br>Add h1 tags at the top of the body to introduce the content (Assignment 1, Assignment 2, etc.).
        <br>Convert all paragraphs to valid HTML using paragraph (p) tags.
        <br>Use the editor to correctly format the HTML code (right-click, Format Document).
        <br>Add an assignment9.html page with valid HTML to your webite. Content will be added below.
        <br>Add an index.html page that provides links to the other pages. See https://dbraunsc.github.io/ for an
        example.
        <br>Test website navigation by visiting your repository website at username.github.io.
        <br>Validate all web pages using the W3C HTML Validator.

    <p>Create a 100-word summary of what you learned while completing the activities in this lesson and describe how you
        can apply that learning to your own current or future environment. Note that this is a learning summary, not an
        action summary. It is not necessary to describe specific steps completed, as those are already listed in the
        course materials. Instead, focus your summary efforts on what you learned from the activities and how you
        envision being able to apply these concepts. See the Assignment Rubric under Course Materials for more
        information</p>
