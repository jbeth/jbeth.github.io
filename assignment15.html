        Lesson 15 covered Project Management and the use of Gantt charts to track resources. I had known that Excel
        could be used for creating many different kinds of charts but had not been able to use it effectively for
        resource tracking in the past. I use Excel for all kinds of reports at work from our on-premises virtual
        resource consumption to network quality over time. Having learned in this lesson how to create resource charts,
        I can already think of a few applications at work that would benefit from this style of reporting like my teamâ€™s
        weekly resource capacity report.</p>
